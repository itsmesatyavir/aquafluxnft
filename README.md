## Features

-   **Multi-Account Support**: Runs tasks for all private keys listed in `accounts.txt`.
-   **Automated Task Flow**: For each account, the bot performs the following sequence:
    1.  Logs into the AquaFlux API.
    2.  **Claims** testnet tokens.
    3.  **Combines** tokens to meet holding requirements.
    4.  **Mints** the Standard NFT.
    5.  **Mints** the Premium NFT (if the account is eligible).
-   **Proxy Support**: Flexible proxy integration with three modes:
    1.  Free public proxies (fetched automatically).
    2.  Private proxies from `proxy.txt`.
    3.  No proxy.
-   **Error Handling & Retries**: Includes robust error handling and retries for both API requests and blockchain transactions.
-   **Scheduled Execution**: After processing all accounts, the bot waits for 24 hours before a potential next run.
